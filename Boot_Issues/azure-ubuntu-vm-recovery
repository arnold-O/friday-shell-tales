# 🧩 Command Line Confessions: The Case of the Silent Ubuntu VM

## 🧠 Overview

This case began when a customer reported that their **Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM)** hosted on **Microsoft Azure** suddenly refused to boot.
The Azure portal showed the VM as **healthy**, but every attempt to start it resulted in a failure to initialize the operating system.

In this post, we’ll go through:

* The **investigation and recovery steps** we followed
* **What each command does**, and why it matters
* **Lessons learned** about diagnosing Linux boot failures in the cloud

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Pause and Protect the System

Before making any changes, we **stopped (deallocated)** the affected VM.

This ensures:

* No further data changes occur while troubleshooting
* Disk consistency is preserved for snapshot operations

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Build a Rescue Environment

We created a **rescue VM** with these properties:

* Same OS version (Ubuntu)
* Same generation (Gen 1 or Gen 2)
* Same resource group and region

Then we:

1. Took a **snapshot** of the affected VM’s **OS disk**
2. Created a **new managed disk** from that snapshot
3. **Attached the disk** to the rescue VM

This setup allows us to mount and inspect the broken disk safely — without risking data corruption.

---

## 🧭 Step 3: Access the Broken System

SSH into the rescue VM and switch to the root user:

```bash
sudo su -
```

**Explanation:**
`sudo su -` elevates privileges to the root account, ensuring full system-level access.

Identify the attached disk:

```bash
dmesg | grep SCSI
```

**Explanation:**

* `dmesg` displays system messages since boot.
* Filtering for “SCSI” helps identify new disks attached to the VM.
* Look for entries like:

  ```
  [ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk
  ```

  Here, `/dev/sdc` is the new disk we’ll recover.

---

## 🪟 Step 4: Mount the Disk

Create a mount point and attach the partitions:

```bash
mkdir /rescue
mount /dev/sdc1 /rescue
mount /dev/sdc16 /rescue/boot
mount /dev/sdc15 /rescue/boot/efi
```

**Explanation:**
These commands make the disk’s files accessible under the `/rescue` directory.
Older Ubuntu images may not have all partitions — you can ignore errors for non-existent ones.

Next, we mount system-level directories to simulate a running environment:

```bash
mount -t proc /proc /rescue/proc
mount -t sysfs /sys /rescue/sys
mount -o bind /dev /rescue/dev
mount -o bind /dev/pts /rescue/dev/pts
mount -o bind /run /rescue/run
```

**Explanation:**
These mounts are essential for tools like `grub-install` and `update-initramfs`, which expect access to `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, and `/run`.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Enter the Affected System (chroot)

```bash
chroot /rescue
```

**Explanation:**
The `chroot` command changes the apparent root directory for the current process to `/rescue`.
From this point onward, any command we run operates *as if* we were logged directly into the broken system.

---

## ⚙️ Step 6: Repair the Bootloader (GRUB)

Within the chroot environment, we reinstalled the **GRUB bootloader**:

```bash
grub-install /dev/sdX
update-grub
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your disk (e.g. `/dev/sdc`).

**Explanation:**

* `grub-install` installs GRUB on the system’s boot disk.
* `update-grub` regenerates the configuration file (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`) so it correctly references the kernel and initrd images.

---

## 🧱 Step 7: Rebuild the initramfs

Next, we regenerated the **initramfs**, the initial RAM filesystem used during early boot:

```bash
update-initramfs -c -k all
```

**Explanation:**
This creates fresh initramfs images for all installed kernels.
It ensures all required drivers (storage, network, etc.) are present during boot — a common fix when systems hang early in startup.

---

## 🧹 Step 8: Exit and Clean Up

Exit the chroot and unmount everything cleanly:

```bash
exit
umount /rescue/proc/
umount /rescue/sys/
umount /rescue/dev/pts
umount /rescue/dev/
umount /rescue/run
cd /
umount /rescue/boot/efi
umount /rescue/boot
umount /rescue
```

If you encounter a “busy” error:

```bash
umount -l /rescue
```

Detach the repaired disk from the rescue VM, reattach it to the **original VM**, and start it again.

✅ The VM booted successfully, confirming the recovery was complete.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Summary

After the investigation, we discovered that:

* The **GRUB configuration** was corrupted, likely due to an interrupted kernel update.
* The **initramfs** was outdated, missing critical drivers for booting under Azure’s virtual hardware.
  Reinstalling GRUB and regenerating the initramfs restored proper boot functionality.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1. **“Healthy” status ≠ Healthy OS**
   Azure’s health probes focus on the hypervisor layer, not the guest OS integrity.
2. **Snapshots are your safety net**
   Always snapshot before deep system changes.
3. **The chroot method is powerful**
   It’s like performing system surgery from outside the body.
4. **Regenerating initramfs**
   Often overlooked, but it’s the secret to resolving persistent boot loops.
5. **Documentation matters**
   Recording each step ensures future recoveries are faster and safer.
