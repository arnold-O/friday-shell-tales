**Understanding ownership**

Every file have three ( 3 ) entities that can be used to set the permissions/ownership, these entities are "user", "group" and "other"

The checks for permissions for file/directory follows the other they have been listed above ( user, group and other). 
If a usr wants to acces a file, Linux first checks if the user is the owner taht checking the user entity, then if not linux moves
to the group if the user is part of the group and neither user or group checks out it goes to the other entity to grant/ deny the 
permission.

These permission enttities are represented as 
 r == Read
 w == write
 x == Execute

 We have a hyphen or dash to represent ths for each file for:

 user - - -  the three hyphen to be filled with R W x
 group - - - the same with r w x
 other - - -  same as above with r w x

The id <username> command, from our user-creation series, displays a user’s UID, GID, and group memberships.

By default, a user’s primary group is the group assigned when the user is created. When a user creates a file or directory, that primary group is automatically set as the group owner of the newly created file or directory.

For example, when a user named testuser creates a file or directory, testuser becomes both the owner and the group owner of that file by default.

This behavior is not fixed and can be changed manually, as we will explore later in this series.as this series progresses.


Use of chown

chown stands for change owner/ownership. This command is used to change the owner of a file or directory, and it can also be used to change the group ownership at the same time. to.

For example:
chown <testuser1> <file/directoy>

The command above changes the owner of the specified file or directory to testuser1.

As mentioned earlier, chown can modify both the owner and the group simultaneously by using a colon (:) as a separator, as shown below:

chown testuser:<groupname>  <file/directory>

This command changes the ownership of a file or directory to the specified user (testuser) and group (groupname). Adding the `-R` flag makes the command recursive, ensuring that all files and subdirectories within the specified directory inherit the same ownership.

While `chown` is used to change both the owner and group of a file, there is a dedicated command for changing only the group ownership: `chgrp`. To change the group ownership alone, the command becomes:

```bash
chgrp <groupname> <file/directory>
```

If you want to change both the owner and group at the same time, you can use `chown` with the following syntax:

```bash
chown <owner>:<groupname> <file/directory>
```


The permission table and the meaning for files and directories:

| Action   | Directory       | File       | Numerical Value |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Read     | List contents   | Open file  | 4               |
| Write    | Create/Delete   | Modify     | 2               |
| Execute  | Enter directory | Run file   | 1               |


The Read permission is quite tricky as user with read on a directory can list the content on the directory bur can only read the content on that directory if the files or content on the directory permssion is correct, that is to say the read on a directory only list the content and reasding its content is purely the permissions on the content.



**Permission Using Numeric Mode**

As shown in the table above, numeric values are used to set permissions on a file. These values range from 0 to 7, representing combinations of read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions. The sum of these values determines the permission level.

For example:
- `4` (read)
- `2` (write)
- `1` (execute)

If a number other than 4, 2, or 1 is used, it is broken down into these components. For instance, `7` is the sum of `4 + 2 + 1`, meaning read, write, and execute permissions are granted.

**Numeric Mode Usage**

The numeric mode assigns permissions to three entities: user, group, and others. For example:

```bash
chmod 767 <filename>
```

Here:
- `7` (user) = `4 + 2 + 1` → `rwx` (read, write, execute)
- `6` (group) = `4 + 2` → `rw-` (read, write)
- `7` (others) = `4 + 2 + 1` → `rwx` (read, write, execute)


Another example : if we have  chmod 325 <filename>

In this case:
user == 3  this further translate to 2 + 1 = 3; hence for this file user has -wx
group == 2 this further translate to 2  = 6; hence for this file group has -w-
other == 5  this further translate to 4 + 1 = 5; hence for this file user has r-x

These scenerios will help you understand the numeric mode usage if the additional and number break is not entirely clear

Number           Permission Type              symbol
0                  no permission               ---
1                  Execute                     --x
2                  write                       -w-
3                  Execute + Write             -wx
4                  Read                        r--
5                  Read + Execute              r-x
6                  Read + Write                rw-
7                  Read + write + Execute      rwx

ACCESS CONTROL LIST

This is another layer that runs on top of our native permissions mentioned above.
The commands to assign and remove ACL permissions are 
setfacl
getfacl

The setfacl helps in setting this extra layer of permission while,
The getfacl helps you to know the acl permission already on it.


Setting up ACL

I. To add a permission  to a user
setfacl -m u:username:rwx /path-to/file

II. To add a permission  to a group
setfacl -m g:groupname:rwx /path-to/file

To allow the subdirectory to inherit same permission
add the -R flag to the command 

hence commands becomes  setfacl -Rm g:groupname:rwx /path/to/file

III. To remove the ACL from a specific user
setfacl -x u:user: /path/to/file

IV. To remove all entries
setfacl -b /opath/to/file

As you assign acl to a file/directory a plus sign is added to the end of the permission.

When you use getfacl on a file , let say file.txt, the output looks like;

# file: file.txt
# owner: alice
# group: staff
user::rw-
user:bob:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::---

Example of giving a specific user permission using ACL;
setfacl -m u:bob:rw file.txt

-m = modify ACL

u:bob:rw → give Bob read + write

file.txt = target file

i. Give a specific group permission
setfacl -m g:devs:r file.txt
g:devs:r → all members of devs group get read permission

ii. Remove ACL for a user
setfacl -x u:bob file.txt



Using the chmod for permission  ( To know more about chmod  run man chmod to know more )

Examples of using u:g:o:a to change permissions

1. Give the owner full access:
chmod u+rwx <path/to/file>

2. Give the group read and write access:
chmod g+rw <path/to/file>

3. Give others only read access:
chmod o+r file.txt

4. Give everyone execute permission:
chmod a+x script.sh

5. Remove write permission from everyone:
chmod a-w file.txt

6. Apply all permission entities in one goal:
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o-rwx backup.sh

umask (user file-creation mode mask)

For 

umask defines which permissions are removed when files or directories are created:

Files start from 666

Directories start from 777

Final permissions = Base − umask

Examples of `umask`:

- `0002`: Files get `u=rw-, g=rw-, o=r--`.
- `0022`: Files get `u=rw-, g=r--, o=r--`.
