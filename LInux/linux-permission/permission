**Understanding ownership**

Every file have three ( 3 ) entities that can be used to set the permissions/ownership, these entities are "user", "group" and "other"

The checks for permissions for file/directory follows the other they have been listed above ( user, group and other). 
If a usr wants to acces a file, Linux first checks if the user is the owner taht checking the user entity, then if not linux moves
to the group if the user is part of the group and neither user or group checks out it goes to the other entity to grant/ deny the 
permission.

These permission enttities are represented as 
 r == Read
 w == write
 x == Execute

 We have a hyphen or dash to represent ths for each file for:

 user - - -  the three hyphen to be filled with R W x
 group - - - the same with R W x
 other - - -  same as above with R W x

add a file here 

 id <username>
  from our user-creation series this gives us the user and it group and id.

The primary group of a user is by default the name of the group usered when a file/dir is created this can be changed.

For example a user by name testuser create a file file/directory by default this user becomes the owner and group ownwer of the file been created.

But this can be changed manually as we will see as this series progresses.
