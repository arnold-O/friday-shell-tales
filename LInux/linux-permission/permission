**Understanding ownership**

Every file have three ( 3 ) entities that can be used to set the permissions/ownership, these entities are "user", "group" and "other"

The checks for permissions for file/directory follows the other they have been listed above ( user, group and other). 
If a usr wants to acces a file, Linux first checks if the user is the owner taht checking the user entity, then if not linux moves
to the group if the user is part of the group and neither user or group checks out it goes to the other entity to grant/ deny the 
permission.

These permission enttities are represented as 
 r == Read
 w == write
 x == Execute

 We have a hyphen or dash to represent ths for each file for:

 user - - -  the three hyphen to be filled with R W x
 group - - - the same with R W x
 other - - -  same as above with R W x
