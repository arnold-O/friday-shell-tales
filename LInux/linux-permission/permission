**Understanding ownership**

Every file have three ( 3 ) entities that can be used to set the permissions/ownership, these entities are "user", "group" and "other"

The checks for permissions for file/directory follows the other they have been listed above ( user, group and other). 
If a usr wants to acces a file, Linux first checks if the user is the owner taht checking the user entity, then if not linux moves
to the group if the user is part of the group and neither user or group checks out it goes to the other entity to grant/ deny the 
permission.

These permission enttities are represented as 
 r == Read
 w == write
 x == Execute

 We have a hyphen or dash to represent ths for each file for:

 user - - -  the three hyphen to be filled with R W x
 group - - - the same with R W x
 other - - -  same as above with R W x

add a file here 

 id <username>
  from our user-creation series this gives us the user and it group and id.

The primary group of a user is by default the name of the group usered when a file/dir is created this can be changed.

For example a user by name testuser create a file file/directory by default this user becomes the owner and group ownwer of the file been created.

But this can be changed manually as we will see as this series progresses.


Use of chown

chown == stands for change ower/ownership
This commands acts as in two in one; used to change the owner of a file/dir as well as change the group the file/dir belongs to.

For example:
chown <testuser1> <file/directoy>

this above command changes the owner of his directory or file to testuser1. As earlier mention to user this command to change the owner and the group simultaneously we use the colon sepearator as seen below

chown testuser:<groupname>  <file/directory>

this above command changes the file or directory to ownwer testuser and group to groupname used. in this command the -R can be added to make the command recursive as againt making sure what ever is inside the dirtory follows suit with the ownership.
Though chown works to change the ownwer of file and group ownwershipbut ther e is a dedicated command to change the group ownership and that is chgrp. And again to chnage the group alone with owner of file the commands becomes

chown :<groupname>  <file/directory>

he permission table and the meaning for files and directory

          | Directory | File   |Numerical values
   List   | list      |  open  |    4
   write  | create/del| modify |    2
execute   | cd        | Run    |    1


The Read permission is quite tricky as user with read on a directory can list the content on the directory bur can only read the content on that directory if the files or content on the directory permssion is correct, that is to say the read on a directory only list the content and reasding its content is purely the permissions on the content.


Permission Using Mumeric Mode

Just like the table above, numeric values can be used to set the permission on a file.
Some persons get it confuse but the actual numbers are from 0 - 7, but on a higher lever it is just 4 2 1 all adding up to 7.

So if you get a number other than those 3 number , the permission is broken down to the 3 numbers.

for example these numbers that are not 4 2 1 are broken into  4 2 1.

Numeric mode Usage 

The usage of numeric mode to change permission on file is tricky.

if we have  chmod 767 <filename>

each value represent user, group and other; the three entities associated with permission.

like I earlier started when the number is not in the values of 4 2 1 the approach is different.

In this case:
user == 7  this further translate to 4 + 2 + 1 = 7; hence for this file user has rwx
group == 6 this further translate to 4 + 2  = 6; hence for this file group has rw-
other == 7  this further translate to 4 + 2 + 1 = 7; hence for this file user has rwx


Another example : if we have  chmod 325 <filename>

In this case:
user == 3  this further translate to 2 + 1 = 3; hence for this file user has -wx
group == 2 this further translate to 2  = 6; hence for this file group has -w-
other == 5  this further translate to 4 + 1 = 5; hence for this file user has r-x

These scenerios will help you understand the numeric mode usage if the additional and number break is not entirely clear

Number           Permission Type              symbol
0                  no permission               ---
1                  Execute                     --x
2                  write                       -w-
3                  Execute + Write             -wx
4                  Read                        r--
5                  Read + Execute              r-x
6                  Read + Write                rw-
7                  Read + write + Execute      rwx

ACCESS CONTROL LIST

This is another layer that runs on top of our native permissions mentioned above.
The commands to assign and remove ACL permissions are 
setfacl
getfacl

The setfacl helps in setting this extra layer of permission while,
The getfacl helps you to know the acl permission already on it.


Setting up ACL

I. To add a permission  to a user
setfacl -m u:username:rwx /path-to/file

II. To add a permission  to a group
setfacl -m g:groupname:rwx /path-to/file

To allow the subdirectory to inherit same permission
add the -R flag to the command 

hence commands becomes  setfacl -Rm g:groupname:rwx /path/to/file
