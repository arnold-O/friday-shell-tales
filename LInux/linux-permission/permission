**Understanding ownership**

Every file have three ( 3 ) entities that can be used to set the permissions/ownership, these entities are "user", "group" and "other"

The checks for permissions for file/directory follows the other they have been listed above ( user, group and other). 
If a usr wants to acces a file, Linux first checks if the user is the owner taht checking the user entity, then if not linux moves
to the group if the user is part of the group and neither user or group checks out it goes to the other entity to grant/ deny the 
permission.

These permission enttities are represented as 
 r == Read
 w == write
 x == Execute

 We have a hyphen or dash to represent ths for each file for:

 user - - -  the three hyphen to be filled with R W x
 group - - - the same with R W x
 other - - -  same as above with R W x

add a file here 

 id <username>
  from our user-creation series this gives us the user and it group and id.

The primary group of a user is by default the name of the group usered when a file/dir is created this can be changed.

For example a user by name testuser create a file file/directory by default this user becomes the owner and group ownwer of the file been created.

But this can be changed manually as we will see as this series progresses.


Use of CHOWN

chown == stands for change ower/ownership
This commands acts as in two in one; used to change the owner of a file/dir as well as change the group the file/dir belongs to.

For example:
chown <testuser1> <file/directoy>

this above command changes the owner of his directory or file to testuser1. As earlier mention to user this command to change the owner and the group simultaneously we use the colon sepearator as seen below

chown testuser:<groupname>  <file/directory>

this above command changes the file or directory to ownwer testuser and group to groupname used. in this command the -R can be added to make the command recursive as againt making sure what ever is inside the dirtory follows suit with the ownership.
Though chown works to change the ownwer of file and group ownwershipbut ther e is a dedicated command to change the group ownership and that is chgrp. And again to chnage the group alone with owner of file the commands becomes

chown :<groupname>  <file/directory>
