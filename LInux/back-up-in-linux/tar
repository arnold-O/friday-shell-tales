Tar (Tape ARchiver) is a standard Linux/Unix utility used to archive multiple files and directories into a single file, optionally compressing the result.
It is commonly used for system backups, application data backups, and file transfers.

Tar is an archiver, not a full backup system. It does not handle scheduling, deduplication, encryption (by default), or incremental tracking automatically.


**Usage of tar**

Most importantly the use of this file require you specify the -c for the creation and -f for the file  name that will be outputted 

tar  -cf <outputfile_name>  <file_to_backup>

tar by default does not do compression, if compression is needed  tar has support for bzip and gzip and frequently used is gzip
For adding this extra utiliy we call it in the options and the command becomes.

tar -czf <name_of_file>.tar.gzip <file_to_backup> for convention purposes we add .tar and .gzip to show the tar utility was used and was compressed with gzip.

Note: the f in the options should be last in the options, as after the f is the filename and the "v" can be added for verbose purposes.





**Extracting**
tar -xzf <the_backup_file/file_path_to_the_file>
This help extract the file back

There is a command line command by default for backup cases like this it helps preserve permissions of files that have been compressed but this is different from distro to distro, so it wise to add that option manually.

In thhe explaination above the tar command and it options sees a "p" been added to the command.

tar -czpf <name_of_file>.tar.gzip <file_to_backup>









Example:

tar -cvf backup.tar /home/user/data

Common Backup Commands
Create an Archive
tar -cvf backup.tar /path/to/data

Create a Compressed Backup
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /path/to/data

Compression	Option	Notes
gzip	-z	Fast, common
bzip2	-j	Smaller size, slower
xz	-J	Best compression, slow
zstd	--zstd	Modern, fast & efficient
Extract a Backup
tar -xvf backup.tar


With compression:

tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz


Extract to a specific directory:

tar -xvf backup.tar -C /restore/path

List Contents (Without Extracting)
tar -tvf backup.tar

Preserving File Metadata (IMPORTANT)

For system backups, always preserve ownership and permissions:

sudo tar -cpvzf backup.tar.gz /etc /home

Option	Meaning
-p	Preserve permissions
-c	Create archive
-v	Verbose
-f	File name
Incremental Backups
Create Incremental Backup
tar -g snapshot.snar -czvf backup.tar.gz /data


snapshot.snar tracks file changes

First run = full backup

Later runs = incremental backups

Caveat: Loss of snapshot file breaks restore chain.
