Tar (Tape ARchiver) is a standard Linux/Unix utility used to archive multiple files and directories into a single file, optionally compressing the result.
It is commonly used for system backups, application data backups, and file transfers.

Tar is an archiver, not a full backup system. It does not handle scheduling, deduplication, encryption (by default), or incremental tracking automatically.

Why Use tar for Backups?

Widely available on all Linux distributions

Preserves file permissions and ownership

Supports compression (gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd)

Works with pipes, SSH, and scripts

Reliable for system snapshots and data archives

Basic Syntax
tar [OPTIONS] [ARCHIVE] [FILES or DIRECTORIES]


Example:

tar -cvf backup.tar /home/user/data

Common Backup Commands
Create an Archive
tar -cvf backup.tar /path/to/data

Create a Compressed Backup
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /path/to/data

Compression	Option	Notes
gzip	-z	Fast, common
bzip2	-j	Smaller size, slower
xz	-J	Best compression, slow
zstd	--zstd	Modern, fast & efficient
Extract a Backup
tar -xvf backup.tar


With compression:

tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz


Extract to a specific directory:

tar -xvf backup.tar -C /restore/path

List Contents (Without Extracting)
tar -tvf backup.tar

Preserving File Metadata (IMPORTANT)

For system backups, always preserve ownership and permissions:

sudo tar -cpvzf backup.tar.gz /etc /home

Option	Meaning
-p	Preserve permissions
-c	Create archive
-v	Verbose
-f	File name
Incremental Backups
Create Incremental Backup
tar -g snapshot.snar -czvf backup.tar.gz /data


snapshot.snar tracks file changes

First run = full backup

Later runs = incremental backups

Caveat: Loss of snapshot file breaks restore chain.
