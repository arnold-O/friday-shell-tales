dd is a low-level Unix/Linux utility used to copy raw data block by block from one location to another.
It is commonly used for disk imaging, full device backups, bootloader copying, and forensic duplication.

dd is extremely powerful and dangerous if misused.
A single wrong command can permanently destroy data.

What Makes dd Different?

Unlike tar, dd Works at the block/device level

Copies everything, including:

Filesystems

Free space

Deleted data

Boot records

Is filesystem-agnostic (ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT, etc.)

Basic Syntax
dd if=<input> of=<output> [options]

dd actual meaning is copy and convert; it could copy a disk and convert it as well It stands for 'Copy and Convert' and was renamed to dd only because cc was reserved for the C compiler!.
dd really shines and is able to get the bare image of a disk.

**USAGE**
dd if=/dev/sda  of=/mnt/storage/sda.img

what the above commands means is that we are cloning sda to /storage/sda.img ; clloning the entire size of sda, this might take some time and probably if there are read and writes it might be affected depending on were dd is at, the time of the operation.

++++When we need to see progressof the operations kindly add **status=progress**
++++To increase speed of transfer we add the option bs=1M; this is saying grab 1 megabytes a second
