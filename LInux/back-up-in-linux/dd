dd is a low-level Unix/Linux utility used to copy raw data block by block from one location to another.
It is commonly used for disk imaging, full device backups, bootloader copying, and forensic duplication.

dd is extremely powerful and dangerous if misused.
A single wrong command can permanently destroy data.

What Makes dd Different?

Unlike tar, dd:

Works at the block/device level

Copies everything, including:

Filesystems

Free space

Deleted data

Boot records

Is filesystem-agnostic (ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT, etc.)

Basic Syntax
dd if=<input> of=<output> [options]
