rsync is a fast and flexible Linux utility used to synchronize files and directories between locations.
It is one of the most commonly used tools for incremental backups, remote backups, and mirroring data.

Unlike tar or dd, rsync is file-aware and only transfers changed data, making it efficient and scalable.
