Managing users and groups

In the Linux environment, there are two common types of users: system (service) users and human users. Service users are created for running services and require access only to specific configuration files. If proper access is not provided, a service may default to using the root account. In Linux, this is discouraged because the root account is extremely powerful, and its usage should be minimized.

Service accounts are typically created by the system and use user IDs (UIDs) in the range of 1–999.

Human users, or users created for people who need access to a server or client machine, generally have UIDs starting from 1000. These users are assigned login shells such as /bin/bash or /bin/sh. In contrast, service users usually do not require interactive logins and are often assigned shells like /sbin/nologin.

Among all users, there is a special user with UID 0, which bypasses all security restrictions. This user is known as the root user.



1. **Creating Users**

There is a shortcut I use when working on linux to give me a broader overview of the command or utility that i'm working with, this has helped me accross many distros of linux.
when you are face with with command , you are no that familiar with, after typing the command press tab key twice to give you more options or use the --help flag for how best to use and apply the command. ( see in the image below).

i. the figure is for clicking tab twice for more options

ii. This figure is for using the --help flag on a command.
![more options](image-1.png)

in  creating a user we use the "useradd" command to create a user. this commands gives us the user created as well as a directory owned by the user usually on /home/<username>. please note by default the directory for ths user is crated in this directory and this can also be altered at the point of creation. And in this directory you will have files created there at pooint of creating the user. These files create the bash shell for bash shell user, this is possible by the skeleton directory which is found in /etc/skel.

Hence this file /etc/skel can be user to create files we want each user to have at point of creation. (as seen in the image below)

Here we can see a test user has been created with name testuser and its directory is on /home

![create user](image-3.png)

![user in home directory](image-2.png)


Now when we find our way into that directory we have this files that normal just the command list (ls) will not bring out, until we add the flag -a to display hidden file then we find this files that have be added to the user home directory upon creation.

![user directory files](image-4.png)


From the above frame we could see the default files added to this user directory upon creation, just to show you we could ourselves add file our self; i will add a file to the /etc/skel file and create a user afterwards and show this. ( I created two files so you don't confuse the dot (.) in creation of files to create hidden files)
![skel directory](image-5.png)

Before moving forward to user properties and their modifications, there is also a one -liner approach in creating a user , that helps sets alot of user properties.

**useradd -m -d /home/testuser3  -c "Testuser Three" -s /bin/bash -G teamthree  -u 1035 -g users -e 2027-12-31 testuser3**

-m → create home directory

-d /home/username → set custom home directory

-c "Full Name" → comment (usually full name)

-s /bin/bash → login shell

-G sudo,developers → supplementary groups

-u 1001 → specific UID

-g users → primary group

-e YYYY-MM-DD → account expiration date


2. **User Configuration files**


These files are important to user management in linux

/etc/defaults/useradd
/etc/login.defs
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/group

The first two files /etc/defaults and /etc/login.defs are conflicting sometimes but if decisions comes down to these files the /etc/login.defs takes lead. 

/etc/skel   this is the skeleton directory
/etc/passwd  This directory houses a bulk of user details
/ec/shadow  Here you find password management properties
/ec/group This help manage user group details and can be understood better in man 5 page of the linux manual.


for the onliner approach of creating a user, where lost of default parameters are specified if the user ID was specify, le say 1234, in the creation series of subsequent users the order will be maintained if no specified enfactically, if one liner specified 1234, the next user to be creaed will use the order and it ID will be 1235.


3. Adding a user to a group

To get better more options type group and hit tab tab on the keyboard.
The user group files and its properties is found in /etc/group .

We create groups to further organize users and manage membership.

This file /etc/group can be edited using the vi/vim editor . This file can also be edited with a special vi command that is vigr which specifical made to edit groups.

This gives the file a temporal file that is only save when you actually save and exit the editor mode.

Usermod command aalso help to manager user group with options like 
- g make the user group as primary group
- G New list of the supplementary list
- a Appends users to supplementary group

To see the properties and group of a user use id and the user name e.g id <username>

User Group

We have two tpes of groups.

i. Primary group
ii. Secondary Group

Primary Group: This is a mandatory group , that is created automatically when a user is created. The name of the user by default is the name of this group. This group are primarily used for ownership. This is related to permission.

Secondary Group: This is used to grant additional permission to user and special funtion. fr example the adding of users to sudo group is a typical example to give that user root priviledges.
To find out the primary groups and secondary group a user belongs to type " id <username>". The primary group appears first then the secondary groups.
