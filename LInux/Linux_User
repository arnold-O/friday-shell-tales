Managing users and groups

In the Linux environment, there are two common types of users: system (service) users and human users. Service users are created for running services and require access only to specific configuration files. If proper access is not provided, a service may default to using the root account. In Linux, this is discouraged because the root account is extremely powerful, and its usage should be minimized.

Service accounts are typically created by the system and use user IDs (UIDs) in the range of 1–999.

Human users, or users created for people who need access to a server or client machine, generally have UIDs starting from 1000. These users are assigned login shells such as /bin/bash or /bin/sh. In contrast, service users usually do not require interactive logins and are often assigned shells like /sbin/nologin.

Among all users, there is a special user with UID 0, which bypasses all security restrictions. This user is known as the root user.



1. **Creating Users**

There is a shortcut I often use when working on Linux to get a broader overview of the command or utility I am working with. This approach has been helpful across many Linux distributions.

When you encounter a command that you are not familiar with, you can type the command name and press the Tab key twice to display available options. Alternatively, you can use the --help flag to view usage information and available options for the command (as shown in the image below).

When creating a user in Linux, we use the useradd command. This command creates the user account and, by default, also creates a home directory for the user, usually located at /home/<username>. It is important to note that the default home directory location can be modified at the time of user creation.

When a user account is created, several files are automatically added to the user’s home directory. These files help configure the user’s shell environment, especially for Bash users. This is done using the skeleton directory, located at /etc/skel.

The /etc/skel directory contains default files that are copied into a new user’s home directory during account creation. By customizing /etc/skel, administrators can ensure that every new user starts with specific configuration files (as shown in the image below).

For example, a test user named testuser has been created, and its home directory is located under /home.

When we navigate to a user’s home directory, some files are hidden by default and are not displayed with the standard ls command. To view these files, we can use the -a flag with ls, which shows all files, including hidden ones.

For example, running:
ls -a   
This command above will reveal all hidden files that were added to the user’s home directory during account creation.

From the image above, we can see the default files that are added to a user’s home directory during account creation. To demonstrate that we can customize these files ourselves, I will add a file to the /etc/skel directory and then create a new user. The files from /etc/skel will be copied into the new user’s home directory.

Note: I created two files in /etc/skel to avoid confusion with using a dot (.) to create hidden files.

Before moving forward to user properties and their modifications, there is also a one-liner approach in creating a user , that helps sets alot of user properties.

**useradd -m -d /home/testuser3  -c "Testuser Three" -s /bin/bash -G teamthree  -u 1035 -g users -e 2027-12-31 testuser3**

-m → create home directory

-d /home/username → set custom home directory

-c "Full Name" → comment (usually full name)

-s /bin/bash → login shell

-G sudo,developers → supplementary groups

-u 1001 → specific UID

-g users → primary group

-e YYYY-MM-DD → account expiration date


2. **User Configuration files**


These files are important to user management in linux

/etc/defaults/useradd
/etc/login.defs
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/group

The first two files /etc/defaults and /etc/login.defs are conflicting sometimes but if decisions comes down to these files the /etc/login.defs takes lead. 

/etc/skel   this is the skeleton directory
/etc/passwd  This directory houses a bulk of user details
/ec/shadow  Here you find password management properties
/ec/group This help manage user group details and can be understood better in man 5 page of the linux manual.


For a one-liner approach to creating a user, many default parameters can be specified. For example, if a specific user ID (UID) is assigned—say 1234—then for subsequent users created without explicitly specifying a UID, the system will continue the sequence. In this case, the next user created will automatically receive UID 1235, maintaining a consistent order.


3. Adding a user to a group

To get better more options type group and hit tab tab on the keyboard.
The user group files and its properties is found in /etc/group .

We create groups to further organize users and manage membership.

This file /etc/group can be edited using the vi/vim editor . This file can also be edited with a special vi command that is vigr which specifical made to edit groups.

This gives the file a temporal file that is only save when you actually save and exit the editor mode.

Usermod command aalso help to manager user group with options like 
- g make the user group as primary group
- G New list of the supplementary list
- a Appends users to supplementary group

To see the properties and group of a user use id and the user name e.g id <username>

User Group

We have two tpes of groups.

i. Primary group
ii. Secondary Group

Primary Group: This is a mandatory group , that is created automatically when a user is created. The name of the user by default is the name of this group. This group are primarily used for ownership. This is related to permission.

Secondary Group: This is used to grant additional permission to user and special funtion. fr example the adding of users to sudo group is a typical example to give that user root priviledges.
To find out the primary groups and secondary group a user belongs to type " id <username>". The primary group appears first then the secondary groups.
