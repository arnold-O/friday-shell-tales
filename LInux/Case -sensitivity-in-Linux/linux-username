 Case Sensitivity in Linux Usernames & Home Directories

 Recently, I worked on a Linux issue that looked minor at first but caused unexpected user and group management problems.

The username was lowercase, while the home directory used uppercase characters.

Example:

User: appuser
Home directory: /home/AppUser

Linux is case-sensitive by design, meaning appuser and AppUser are treated as completely different entities.

**Technical Basis**

On the technical level, I will explain this on two front;

**Firstly from the filesystem level**
Linux filesystems, the ext4 and xfs treat paths with different cases as distinct.
/home/appuser and /home/AppUser are two separate directories.

**Secondly from the lookup level** User and group lookups rely on exact string matching. This lookup are down as against files on directory such as /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow. Any mismatch leads to lookup failures or unexpected behavior.
