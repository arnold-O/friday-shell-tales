 Case Sensitivity in Linux Usernames & Home Directories

 Recently, I worked on a Linux issue that looked minor at first but caused unexpected user and group management problems.

The username was lowercase, while the home directory used uppercase characters.

Example:

User: appuser
Home directory: /home/AppUser

Linux is case-sensitive by design, meaning appuser and AppUser are treated as completely different entities.
