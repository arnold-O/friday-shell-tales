Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a device mapper framework that allows flexible disk management in Linux. Unlike traditional partitions, LVM abstracts physical disks into logical volumes, providing dynamic resizing, snapshots, and easier disk management.

Key components:

PV (Physical Volume):
A physical disk or partition initialized for LVM (pvcreate /dev/sdX)

VG (Volume Group)	
Pool of storage consisting of one or more PVs (vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX)

LV (Logical Volume)	
Logical disk carved out from a VG (lvcreate -L 20G -n lv_name vg_name)
